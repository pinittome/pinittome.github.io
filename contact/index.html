<h2>Github</h2>
<p>The best place to log bugs (<i>perish the thought!</i>) is on Github. If you’d like to request features this is also the place to do it. If you’d like to sponsor an accepted feature (to get it deployed more quickly) please get in touch…</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pinittome">Our Github repository</a></p>
<h2>Chat</h2>
<p>As we build a community around the application we’ll look at creating an XMPP MUC channel or an IRC channel for people to ask questions, get help, and share information more rapidly.</p>
<p>Until then please <a href="/contact-us/" class="kblinker" title="More about Contact »">contact</a> us via any other method and if required we’ll arrange email contact.</p>
