[Jonny](http://www.jonnyheavey.com) from the team talked at the inaugural XMPP/Realtime UK event held at [Mozilla London](https://twitter.com/MozLDN). He covered the process of adding new realtime features to an application (chat – coming soon!) and what he’d learned in doing so.

Jonny also gave an excellent demonstration of the system to interested on lookers.

Here’s the slides from the talk ([http://www.rvl.io/jonnyheavey/pinittome](http://www.rvl.io/jonnyheavey/pinittome)):
