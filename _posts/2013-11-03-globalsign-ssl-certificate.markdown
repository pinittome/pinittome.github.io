We've upgraded our SSL to one provided for free by a [GlobalSign](https://www.globalsign.co.uk/)  who are providing [wildcard certificates for open source projects](https://www.globalsign.com/ssl/ssl-open-source/).

We're also very happy with our [security rating](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=pinitto.me) which combined with our earlier BEAST attack mitigation work means the system should be fairly secure.

As a thanks to Globalsign please check out their website and consider ordering your next SSL certificates from them. Signup and obtaining a certificate was quick and easy!
