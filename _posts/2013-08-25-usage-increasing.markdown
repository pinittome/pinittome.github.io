Its been a while since we've posted anything, so here's a quick update...

Usage of the site continues to grow. We don't advertise our services so any groth is purely organic. Hopefully increasing user numbers means people are finding the system useful and productive!

Currently the server costs us around $18.50 per month to keep running. If you are finding the site site useful we'd appreciate a donation :)

Remember we don't sell (or mine) your data. You are free to download the project from [github](https://github.com/pinittome) if you would like to run the system yourself. If you would like any boards you own removed please just let us know.
