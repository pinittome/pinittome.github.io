We’re pleased to announce the release of a new feature *Full Access Control!*

From version 0.5.0 users will now have the ability to set access controls on their boards. There are three levels of access, ‘admin’, ‘write’, and ‘read’. &nbsp;To read more about allowed features for each access level please see [access controls]({{ site.url }}/manual/access-controls/).

We realise that the UI/UX isn’t quite perfect (we’d love some feedback on this!) but believe that this new feature adds a huge benefit.

_For example you can share your planning boards with the world without fear that someone will&nbsp;destroy&nbsp;all your data!_

Please add comments about the new feature below, or if you find any issues/can suggest improvements please raise an issue on our (github issue list)[gh-issues].
