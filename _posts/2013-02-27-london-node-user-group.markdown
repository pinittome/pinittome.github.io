At the [Feburary London Node User Group (LNUG)](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lnug-february/) Lloyd had a chance to speak about pinitto.me. Pinitto.me is our open source infinite virtual corkboard applicationto help with planning days for colleagues at [Surevine](http://www.surevine.com).

The system is built upon [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) with [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) providing the persistence, express the http responses, and [socket.io](http://socket.io/) handling the server connections.

The project is on github so we suggest you check it out and get involved if you would like to: [https://github.com/pinittome/pinitto.me](https://github.com/pinittome/pinitto.me).

The talk wasn’t focussed on pinitto.me itself, more importantly [Lloyd](http://www.evilprofessor.co.uk) wanted to talk about how we’re in an exciting place where we’re moving to a realtime web and how node.js and related tools made building realtime applications really simple and fast. Coupled with this he shared a few of the lessons he’d learned in building the application.

Thanks to <a href="http://andrew.github.io/" class="kblinker" target="_blank" title="More about Andrew Nesbitt »">Andrew Nesbitt</a> for organising and if you’re a node.js developer or interested in node.js I suggest you get yourself there for a meetup (if at least for the free pizza and beer).

Here’s the slides from the talk (<a href="http://www.rvl.io/lloydwatkin/pinittome-what-why-how" target="_blank">http://www.rvl.io/lloydwatkin/pinittome-what-why-how</a>).
